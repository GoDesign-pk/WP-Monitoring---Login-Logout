# WP-Monitoring-Login-Logout
This plugin will monitor the activity of the administrator role such as IP address of the origin of person logging in, the creation, editing, or deletion of any file, to be captured and stored in the database

# Original Project Requirements

I have Wordpress websites. The administrator (me), will occasionally login and logout. I want session variables that log me or any administrator out after a period of time with no activity (say, one hour). I want to create a separate MySQL database with the administrator login and lockout identity and activity, such as IP address of the origin of person logging in, the creation, editing, or deletion of any file, to be captured and stored in the database. I want two auto-responses sent to my input e-mail address and SMS phone number, to real original administrator (me) every time anyone logs in immediately.

I have been a PHP/MySQL programmer since 2001 and know this app should require no more than 5 hours of work. I will test everything daily with milestones for every 1-2 hours of work. Thank you.
